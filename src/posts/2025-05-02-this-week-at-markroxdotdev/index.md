## Weekly Progress Update

This week was packed with meaningful progress across multiple fronts:

1. **GenSearch POC (Client A)**
   - Advanced Milestone 2 (Knowledge Layer) and Milestone 3 (Generation Layer).
   - Delivered Decisions documentation, SBOM documentation.
   - Discussed JWT payload and client’s requirement. Designed and implemented a JWT token issuer and verification service, deploying all components into Azure API Management (APIM).
   - Worked with client’s business analysts, started architecture for Azure AI Search configuration.
   - Delivered a successful demo of the **Factlit** tool, which impressed the client’s POC team and showcased the power of fact-grounded outputs.

2. **PCI DSS Project (Client B)**
   - For the partner certification process,, I conducted a demonstration of the **Hosted Payment Control** user experience flows for positive cases (valid cards, valid cards with long wait times) and negative cases (invalid cards, backend failures).
   - The partner approved the solution to move to the next phase.
   - The client team expressed enthusiasm and is eager to move toward productionizing the solution.

3. **Angular/Material UX Development**
   - Shifted the application’s interface from a Grid to a responsive **Card View** solution, greatly enhancing mobile usability.
   - The development team is excited about the new design and provided a punch list of further improvements and feature requests.

4. **Professional Development**
   - Continued training for the **Azure AI Engineer Certification** ([Microsoft official site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification)).
   - Started the **Hugging Face Agents Course** ([Hugging Face learning portal](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit0/introduction)) to deepen expertise on agentic LLM applications.
   - Conducted research into implementing an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** solution, potentially to enhance the GenSearch POC’s architecture.
