## Catch Up, Planning Forward

### Where I've been

#### Work

Last week, I wrapped up work at a client where I was both architect and engineer.  I spent some time and worked with cool stuff in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  Learned a few products and published several architectural decision records (ADRs).  I also was the lead engineer for a good security project to solve root registration by creating an out of band account management feature.

#### SJSL
#### Professional
#### Personal

### My Present State

- Working on a Swift project
- Some architectural deep diving on microservices, Kafka and Elastic.
- AWS Partner: Well-Architected Best Practices (Technical).
- Some work looking at Microsoft Teams App development at the Microsoft Teams Developer Portal.
- Security training
- Projects? Writing? Coding?

### The Path Forward

Of all the things I want to do, what can I complete?
