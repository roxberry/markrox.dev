"The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." 
― William Gibson

## Timeline
Writing some things down for posterity, to remember a year that could have really been bad, and still could be.  But with my wife, my daughters, my family, friends, colleagues, 2020 will definitely be remembered.

### A return to a good client
The year started out with a new contract with a familiar client.

### The nexus of my interest
On my extracurricular list SJSL and my election

### The fear of pandemic
"Buy more food, canned goods, paper products today."  I remember saying this to my wife after reading about the outbreak of some flu in China and stories of it reaching Italy.  I was half believing that my paranoia of things was getting the best of me and half believing that it was going to be bad this time.

### Succeeding despite or because of the isolation

### Achilles revenge



## Thoughts about the future

### Cassandra complex
