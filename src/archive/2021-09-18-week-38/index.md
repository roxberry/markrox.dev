## Week 38 Retrospective

Overall feel - last week was a grind.  Despite that all my projects are green, SJSL went well on Sunday and not a complete disaster, the week in totality felt like a drag.  A few negatives outweighed the positives, hopefully I can flip the script in week 39.

1. Surgery - tough week to focus when one of your children needs surgery.  It was downgraded, prognosis was positive, but it still threw me off to start the week.
1. Project assumption (I assumed ownership for the project) when key personnel are rolled off.  My partner at the client, with me for over a year, had to roll off due to his contract expiring.
1. Dependency - integration blues when systems out of our control are failing.  500s on major service calls, made development and testing untenable.  Need to explain to QA that the errors are integration.
1. Injury - [Haglund’s Deformity and Chronic Achilles Tendonitis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1048666618300211) - barely walking, shooting pain on dorsiflexion of my right foot.
1. Attended the [Snowflake Financial Services Data Summit - Americas](https://www.snowflake.com/financial-services-data-summit/americas/agenda/?login=ML).  This was interesting, FinTech knowledge is on my professional learning goals.
1. [Roll20 MarkUn2](https://app.roll20.net/users/9580215/markun2) Something fun to do, I got back into D&D with a Cleric who thinks all Mages are possessed and need to be exorcised.
