## October Theme - Actualization

### "Actualization"

> To realize in action or make real

[from the Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/actualization)

This month I'll be rolling off the ecom team at ADT.  I lined up a few projects, each I can contribute to right away, so minimal bench time.  As much as I like the *idea* of bench time to catch up on training, I do not like the reality of not being *productive* for my company and clients.

I picked the theme "actualization" to drive my activities and decisions to realize something tangible, measurable.  October's 3rd wins are based on this theme: new client and great potential, upgrade the AWS team, and demonstrate my proficiency by participating in a panel about privacy data.

## 3 Wins

1. New Business - Blessed by clients who have new work and projects, land new business.
1. AWS Team and Certification Training
1. Security Presentation and Panel on the [OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-privacy-risks/)
