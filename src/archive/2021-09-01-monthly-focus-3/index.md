## Planning for September 2021


### September 2021 Theme

“Habitualization” - building from last month, I will create a daily process to build a knowledge base for my target areas.  

I will set up a Russian word or phrase of the day, reading exercises, CCSP studies and other daily training work in.  

I signed up for [CodeRed](https://codered.eccouncil.org) for CEH credits and other interesting classes.  

I will use my training to guide me in my professional goals.

### September 2021 3 Wins

1. Word of the day, read of the week for Russian
1. Quizlet Review for CCSP
1. Proposal for SJS1, reach out to network (use this to connect to peer professionals)

### Future month win themes

Monetization - carried over from August 2021 - how do I generate revenue from my work?
