## P-9 Inability of users to access and modify data

The [OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-privacy-risks/) identifies the top 10 privacy risks in web applications, the cloud and the global online ecosystem.  In September of 2021, version 2 of the project was released. I'm going to work through the list and discuss each risk, with references and mitigation countermeasures, if they exist.

The P-9 risk, "Inability of users to access and modify data" identifies data lockin by organizations as a privacy risk.

- Users need to have access to their data.  Organizations need to give users the ability change or delete data related to them.

- User access to their data, requests to change or delete their data needs to be processed timely and completely.

- Data needs to be modeled with user access and modification as a priority

Data architects need to consider [Data Portability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability) when designing and modeling user data.
