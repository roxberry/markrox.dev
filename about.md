# About Me

## Intelligent Systems, Secure Delivery, and Purposeful Platforms

I’m the **Intelligent Solutions and Security Solutions Practice Lead** for complex, forward-leaning projects at the intersection of AI, cloud, and architecture. I live at the front edge of best practices, actualization, and delivery.

## Architecting the Future

I lead intelligent system design and AI integration efforts across sectors—from secure encryption platforms in the cloud to RAG-based assistants and confidential computing with SGX. I’ve developed maturity models, consulting frameworks, and rapid POCs for Fortune 500 partners, always with an eye on **secure, observable, and cost-justified** delivery.

## Builder, Writer, Hacker

When I’m not consulting, I’m building. I write code. I write fiction. I lead [OWASP HACTU8](https://owasp.org/www-project-hactu8/), an incubator project focused on **ethical AI hacking** and **model security testing**. I’m passionate about crafting platforms with purpose, including:

- AI Architecture & Applied Intelligence
- Cloud Security (Azure, AWS, Attestation, Zero Trust)
- FinOps & Platform Efficiency
- Open-source & Community Projects (OWASP HACTU8)
- Creative Writing, Game Design, and Theological Sci-Fi

## Data: From Micro to Massive, Always Meaningful

My data journey has spanned the full stack—from embedded databases and edge devices to enterprise ETL systems, **Kafka-based data streams**, and now **vectorized knowledge ingestion and semantic enrichment pipelines** for AI decisioning. I specialize in making data **structured, accessible, and secure**, powering real-time systems and retrieval-augmented reasoning.

## Devices, Robots, and the Real World

My love for physical systems is lifelong. I build and teach with **Lego Mindstorms**, write automations in **MicroPython**, and orchestrate **SLM workflows** across **microcontrollers, sensors, and edge automation**. Whether experimenting with IoT or building educational kits, I believe you learn by making—and the best tech leaders keep their hands dirty.

## Language, Systems, and Human Thought

My academic foundation is as cross-disciplinary as my work. I studied **Russian Technical Translation** at Penn State, earning a degree that straddled linguistics, science, and systems thinking, with minors in **Political Science**, **Business Administration**, and **Biology**. This study of structured language, analytical frameworks, and scientific precision shaped how I approach both human and machine understanding—and still informs the way I design systems, write content, and think about intelligence (natural and artificial).

## Philosophy, Storytelling, and the Human Element

I’m a **philosopher**, **history nerd**, **movie buff**, and **voracious reader**. I believe in systems of meaning as much as systems of code. I’m also a husband to a brilliant and beautiful wife, and a proud father to two extraordinarily talented daughters—both scholars and vocalists—who remind me daily why the work matters.

I’m driven by purpose—whether it’s designing encrypted systems that respect sovereignty and identity, or imagining alternate universes where angels and demons fight for the soul of the cosmos.

You’ll find me equally at home writing YAML or lore, building SwiftUI apps or field kits, helping my kids with algebra, or strategizing how to make ethical technology platforms profitable and humane.

This is my corner of the internet. I share what I’m building, what I’ve learned, and what I believe is worth doing in an age defined by intelligence, intent, and consequence.
